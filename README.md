# CS-370

I was given basic environment setup code, but I created the deep Q-learning algorithm myself. This project helped me understand reinforcement learning and how AI can improve through experience. Computer scientists develop algorithms and software to solve complex problems, making technology more efficient. As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them into steps and testing solutions systematically. My ethical responsibility is to ensure fairness, security, and transparency in AI systems.
